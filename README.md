## Instructions

Start the game by clicking on any card. That will start the timer. The goal of the game is to match all the cards. There are 8 pairs of cards that when matched will end the game. There is a star rating, the more stars the better you did. At the end of the game, a popup will show you your time to complete the game, star rating and how many moves it took. You then have the choice to replay or not. You can restart the game at any time by clicking on the replay arrow near the top right of the score panel. Restarting the game will always result in a new, shuffled deck.

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Other

The original starter code (HTML/CSS) were all supplied by Udacity as a Project folder in which interactivity needs to be added. The following is from the original README file that came with the starter files:

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open js/app.js and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
